The script scans your screenshots folder and organizes its contents by year.

By default, Mac screenshots are saved on the desktop and named in the format *Screenshot YYYY-MM-DD at HH.MM.SS.png.* This script creates folders based on the year and relocates the respective screenshots to the appropriate year folders under Desktop/Screenshots.
